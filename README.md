**Crystallographic Structure-Activity-Relationship model from fragment elaboration in crude reaction mixtures**

## üß¨ Overview

This repository accompanies the manuscript:  
**"A SAR model can be directly extracted from high-throughput crystallographic evaluation of fragment elaboration in crude reaction mixtures"**

It provides a rule-based framework to compute **Positive Binding Scores (PBS)** and **Negative Binding Scores (NBS)** for ligands tested in **crude reaction mixtures (CRMs)** via **X-ray crystallography**. These scores form the basis of the xSAR model, which aids retrospective analysis and prospective virtual screening in fragment-based drug discovery.
