# üìÅ 6_experimental_validation

This folder contains the **GCI assay results** for compounds selected from the prospective virtual screening campaign. Grating-Coupled Interferometry (GCI) was used to experimentally measure kinetic binding parameters for 93 compounds (Prospective-93) against PHIP(2). Assays were performed using the Creoptix¬Æ WAVE system with the WaveRAPID¬Æ injection scheme, and kinetic data were processed using the Direct Kinetics fitting engine.

## üìã Dataset Description

Two datasets are provided:
1. A full set of kinetic results for all tested compounds.
2. A filtered set of hits meeting predefined criteria for kinetic quality and binding signal.

Binding was considered meaningful when:
- **ka and kd error < 25%**
- **Rmax > 10 pg/‚àömm**

Ligand efficiency (LE) was calculated for hit compounds to evaluate interaction efficiency normalised to heavy atom count.

## üîÅ Usage context

These files provide experimental validation of compounds selected through xSAR-guided virtual screening. The data support:
- Assessment of hit rate and kinetic quality of selected virtual screening compounds.
- Classification of follow-up compounds as kinetic hits based on binding parameters
