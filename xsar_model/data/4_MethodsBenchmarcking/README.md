# üìÅ 4_MethodsBenchmarking

This folder contains benchmarking data for ligand-based classification methods used to distinguish crystallographic binders from non-binders in the `OriginalRefined-957` dataset. These benchmark data serve to evaluate the performance of SAR-derived metrics (PBS and NBS) against standard cheminformatics methods such as random forest classification and Tanimoto similarity scoring.

## üìã Dataset Description

For each pose type (`All`, `Lateral`, `Diving`), compounds were split into:
- **Training set**: 860 compounds from `OriginalRefined-957_BeforeReevaluation`, excluding `Retrospective-97`.
- **Test set**: 97 compounds from `Retrospective-97`, with corrected binding labels from the reevaluation.

Three classification methods were applied:
1. **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)** ‚Äî trained on the training set and optimised using Optuna against the test ground truth.
2. **Tanimoto similarity (mean and max)** ‚Äî computed using Morgan fingerprints (radius=6, 2048-bit) with known binders as reference.
3. **PBS and NBS scores** ‚Äî showed in the examples, and evaluated as described in the manuscript.

Random forest hyperparameters were tuned using Optuna (2,500 trials) and applied using scikit-learn. Model evaluation was based on the **Precision-Recall Area Under Curve (PR-AUC)**, averaged across 200 repeats.

## üîÅ Usage context

These files are used to:
- Random forest hyperparameters optimisation
- **Benchmark ligand-based classifiers** on predicting fragment binding outcomes.
- Compare traditional cheminformatics methods to SAR-derived scores (PBS/NBS).
- Assess the **PR-AUC** performance across methods using statistically grounded metrics.

These benchmarking outputs support the evaluation of the xSAR method's performance in a ligand-only prediction setting.
